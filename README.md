Valentin ABGRALL, 2nd-Year InfoSec student in CentraleSup√©lec

I am really interested in computer science, in coding and in cybersecurity. I've taken part in multiple project, course related and personal.
I also am an art enthusiast. I spend a lot of time looking for new books to read, new exhibitions to discover and new plays to watch. I'd love to find a way to mix both my passions : art and computer science.
